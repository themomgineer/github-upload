I am themomgineer --electrical engineer turned stay-at-home mom. I am learning software 
programming for fun! I have enjoyed coding for a long time, but I am quite new to the 
software side of things.

This is my current project: a flash card maker. Yes, I know they already exist. This is
a learning opportunity for me.
