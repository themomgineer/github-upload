# themomgineer.github.io

I am themomgineer --electrical engineer turned stay-at-home mom. I am learning software 
programming for fun! I have enjoyed coding for a long time, but I am quite new to the 
software side of things.

This is my current project: a flash card maker. I am making it as a website because I 
don't know how to make apps yet, but ideally I will turn it into an app at some point.
